# Airlines-Data-Analysis
## Business Problem
#### An airlines company is currently facing challenges due to factors such as stricter environment regulations, higher flight taxes, increased labour costs and rising fuel prices. These factors lead to decrease in companys's profitability and increased investment. To tackle these challenges, they want to conduct an analysis on their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.
## Objective 
#### Increase occupancy rate and improve pricing startegy while enhancing customer experience. The end goal is to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low performing flights which can lead to increased profitability of the airline.
## Key findings
#### The aircraft with highest total revenue is SU9, the reason being most people bought this aircraft's ticket as price of business and economy class is low compared to others. The aircraft with least revenue is CN1 and the possible reason behind this is because it only offers economy class with least price which may be due to poor conditions or due to less facilities.
